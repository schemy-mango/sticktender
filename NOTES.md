I need an example of folder and file structure for a python web app based on FastAPI
Sure, here is an example folder and file structure for a FastAPI web app:

```css
app

/
main.py
requirements.txt
api

/
__init__.py
endpoints

/
__init__.py
example.py
models

/
__init__.py
example.py
services

/
__init__.py
example.py
utils

/
__init__.py
example.py
db

/
__init__.py
session.py
models

/
__init__.py
example.py
tests

/
__init__.py
conftest.py
test_example.py
README.md
```

Here is a brief explanation of each file and folder:

main.py: This is the main entry point for the FastAPI app. It contains the app initialization code and starts the
server.
requirements.txt: This file contains the dependencies required to run the app. You can install them using pip install -r
requirements.txt.
api/endpoints: This folder contains the HTTP endpoints for the app. Each file contains functions that define the HTTP
methods (GET, POST, etc.) for the endpoint.
api/models: This folder contains the data models used by the app. Each file contains a Pydantic model that defines the
schema for the data.
api/services: This folder contains the business logic of the app. Each file contains functions that manipulate data and
perform actions on behalf of the endpoints.
api/utils: This folder contains utility functions used by the app. For example, you might have a file that contains
functions for authentication or validation.
db/session.py: This file contains the database session initialization code. You can use it to create a database session
to connect to the database.
db/models: This folder contains the SQLAlchemy models used by the app. Each file contains a SQLAlchemy model that
defines the database schema for the data.
tests: This folder contains unit tests for the app. Each file contains test functions that assert the expected behavior
of the app.
README.md: This file contains a brief description of the app and how to run it.
Note that this is just one possible structure for a FastAPI web app, and you might have a different structure depending
on the needs of your app.

in this example, where would I place functions responsiblefor user management: account creation, logging in, removing
account, logging out, modifying account information, etc?
In this example, you would place functions responsible for user management in the api/services folder.

You can create a new module within the api/services folder for user management, such as user_service.py. In this module,
you can define functions for account creation, logging in, removing account, logging out, modifying account information,
and any other related user management functions.

For example, you might have functions like:

```python
def create_user(user: UserCreate) -> User:
    # Logic to create a new user
    pass


def authenticate_user(username: str, password: str) -> Optional[User]:
    # Logic to authenticate a user
    pass


def delete_user(user_id: int) -> None:
    # Logic to delete a user
    pass


def update_user(user_id: int, user_update: UserUpdate) -> User:
    # Logic to update a user's information
    pass


def logout_user(user_id: int) -> None:
    # Logic to log out a user
    pass
```

Then, you can import these functions in the endpoint functions in the api/endpoints folder and use them to handle
requests related to user management. For example, you might have an endpoint for creating a new user:

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends

from app.api.models.user import User, UserCreate
from app.api.services.user_service import create_user

router = APIRouter()


@router.post("/users", response_model=User)
async def create_user_endpoint(user: UserCreate, user_service=Depends()):
    return create_user(user)
```

In this example, the create_user_endpoint function depends on the user_service parameter, which is defined in a
Depends() function. This allows you to use the create_user function defined in the user_service.py module to handle the
request.

Note that you might also want to include middleware or other security-related functions in your api/utils folder to
handle things like authentication and authorization.

This will be a plant care app. I want the user to be able to create new entries in their database - one entry for each
of their plant. I want to start with creating a pydantic data model for plants. Can you give me an example of such a
model? Make it verbose.
Sure, here's an example of a Pydantic data model for a plant:

```python
from datetime import date
from typing import List, Optional

from pydantic import BaseModel


class PlantBase(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: Optional[str] = None
    species: Optional[str] = None
    variety: Optional[str] = None
    plant_type: Optional[str] = None
    location: Optional[str] = None


class PlantCreate(PlantBase):
    pass


class Plant(PlantBase):
    id: int
    owner_id: int
    created_at: date

    class Config:
        orm_mode = True
```

This model defines a Plant class with several fields:

id: An integer ID for the plant entry.
owner_id: An integer ID for the owner of the plant entry. This field will be set automatically based on the user who
creates the entry.
created_at: A date object representing the date the plant entry was created. This field will also be set automatically
based on the time the entry is created.
name: A required string field for the name of the plant.
description: An optional string field for a description of the plant.
species: An optional string field for the species of the plant.
variety: An optional string field for the variety of the plant.
plant_type: An optional string field for the type of plant (e.g. succulent, cactus, fern).
location: An optional string field for the location of the plant (e.g. living room, kitchen, balcony).
The PlantBase model defines the fields that are required for creating a new plant entry, while the Plant model adds the
automatically generated fields.

There is also a PlantCreate model that inherits from PlantBase and is used for validating input data when creating a new
plant entry.

Finally, the Config class with orm_mode = True is used to enable the ORM mode for this model, which allows you to use
the Plant model with an ORM library like SQLAlchemy to query the database.

show me fastapi function that will create a new plant entry using the model you've just created
Sure, here's an example FastAPI function that creates a new plant entry using the PlantCreate model:

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

from app.api.models.plant import PlantCreate, Plant
from app.api.dependencies import get_db
from app.db import models

router = APIRouter()


@router.post("/plants", response_model=Plant)
async def create_plant(
        plant: PlantCreate,
        db: Session = Depends(get_db),
        current_user: models.User = Depends(get_current_active_user)
):
    new_plant = models.Plant(
        owner_id=current_user.id,
        created_at=date.today(),
        **plant.dict()
    )
    db.add(new_plant)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(new_plant)
    return new_plant
```

This function creates a new plant entry using the PlantCreate model, and requires a Session dependency and a
current_user dependency. The Session dependency is used to interact with the database, and the current_user dependency
is defined elsewhere and is used to ensure that only authenticated users can create new plant entries.

The function creates a new Plant object using the values from the PlantCreate model and some additional fields that are
set automatically. It then adds the new plant to the database session, commits the changes to the database, refreshes
the object to get the newly generated ID, and returns the new Plant object as the response.

what's inside the app.api.dependencies?
The contents of app.api.dependencies will depend on the specific requirements of your application. However, here is an
example of what could be included in app.api.dependencies for a FastAPI web app:

```python
from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException, status
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer, OAuth2PasswordRequestForm
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

from app.core.config import settings
from app.db import crud, models
from app.db.database import SessionLocal
from app.api.utils import security

oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="/auth/token")


# Dependency to get the database session
def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()


# Dependency to get the current user based on the access token
async def get_current_user(
        db: Session = Depends(get_db),
        token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)
):
    credentials_exception = HTTPException(
        status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
        detail="Could not validate credentials",
        headers={"WWW-Authenticate": "Bearer"},
    )
    user = await security.get_user(token, db)
    if not user:
        raise credentials_exception
    return user


# Dependency to get the current active user
async def get_current_active_user(current_user: models.User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    if not crud.user.is_active(current_user):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Inactive user")
    return current_user
```

This example includes the following dependencies:

get_db(): This is a dependency function that provides a SQLAlchemy session to other functions that need to interact with
the database.

get_current_user(): This is a dependency function that validates the access token provided by the client and returns the
associated user from the database. It raises an exception if the token is invalid or the user is not found.

get_current_active_user(): This is a dependency function that depends on get_current_user() and returns the current user
only if they are active. If the user is not active, it raises an exception.

These dependencies are used in the create_plant() function in the previous example to ensure that only authenticated and
active users can create new plant entries.

what's inside app.db.database ?
The app.db.database module typically contains the code necessary to create and manage the database connection.

Here's an example of what might be inside app.db.database for a FastAPI web app using SQLAlchemy and Postgres:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

from app.core.config import settings

# Define the SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL as a constant
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = settings.database_url

# Create the database engine
engine = create_engine(SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL)

# Create a SessionLocal class that can be used to create database sessions
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)

# Define a base class for SQLAlchemy models
Base = declarative_base()
```

This example does the following:

Defines a constant SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL that contains the URL for the Postgres database. This URL should be defined
in the application's configuration file, such as a .env file.

Creates a SQLAlchemy engine using create_engine(), which takes the database URL as an argument.

Creates a SessionLocal class using sessionmaker(), which can be used to create new sessions that are bound to the
database engine. The autocommit, autoflush, and bind arguments are used to configure the behavior of the sessions.

Defines a Base class using declarative_base(), which can be used as the base class for all SQLAlchemy models in the
application.

These components are used throughout the application to interact with the database. For example, the get_db() dependency
function that I showed earlier might use the SessionLocal class to create a new database session for each request.
Similarly, SQLAlchemy models would inherit from the Base class and use the engine to communicate with the database.

what's inside app.core?
The app.core package usually contains modules that provide functionality that is common to the entire application. These
might include configuration settings, utility functions, and other global resources.

Here's an example of what might be inside app.core for a FastAPI web app:

```python
app /
core /
config.py
security.py
```

This example has two modules inside app.core:

config.py: This module contains the application's configuration settings, such as the database URL, API version, and
other environment-specific settings. The module might define a Settings class that reads these settings from environment
variables or a configuration file and provides them as attributes. For example:

```python
from pydantic import BaseSettings


class Settings(BaseSettings):
    app_name: str = "My App"
    database_url: str = "postgres://user:password@localhost/db"
    debug: bool = False

    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"
```

security.py: This module might contain utility functions for handling authentication and authorization in the
application. For example, it might define functions to generate and verify access tokens, or to hash and verify
passwords. Here's an example of a function that generates a JWT access token:

```python
import jwt
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from typing import Optional

from app.core.config import settings

ALGORITHM = "HS256"


def create_access_token(data: dict, expires_delta: Optional[timedelta] = None):
    to_encode = data.copy()
    if expires_delta:
        expire = datetime.utcnow() + expires_delta
    else:
        expire = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=15)
    to_encode.update({"exp": expire})
    encoded_jwt = jwt.encode(to_encode, settings.secret_key, algorithm=ALGORITHM)
    return encoded_jwt
```

These modules can be imported from anywhere in the application to access their functionality. For example, the
create_access_token() function in app.core.security might be used by a login endpoint to generate an access token for an
authenticated user.

What is the purpose of "models" inside app.db?
The models module inside app.db typically contains the SQLAlchemy models that represent the database tables in the
application.

Here's an example of what might be inside app.db.models for a FastAPI web app:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
from app.db.database import Base


class Plant(Base):
    __tablename__ = "plants"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, index=True)
    species = Column(String, index=True)
    description = Column(String, index=True)
    image_url = Column(String, index=True)
```

In this example, there is a single SQLAlchemy model defined, Plant. This model inherits from the Base class defined in
app.db.database, which provides the database connection and declarative base for all models.

The __tablename__ attribute specifies the name of the table in the database that this model represents. The id, name,
species, description, and image_url attributes define the columns in the table. The Column function is used to define
each column, and takes arguments to specify the data type, primary key status, and indexing of the column.

By defining these models, we can use SQLAlchemy to create and manipulate the corresponding database tables. For example,
we might use the Plant model to create a new entry in the plants table when a user adds a new plant to their collection.
We might also use the model to query the database and retrieve information about the plants that a user has added.

What is the purpose of "Settings" inside core.config?
The Settings class inside app.core.config is typically used to define the application's configuration settings and
provide a standardized way to access them.

In FastAPI applications, Settings is often implemented using the BaseSettings class provided by the Pydantic library.
The BaseSettings class allows us to define configuration settings as class attributes with default values, and then read
those settings from environment variables or a configuration file.

Here's an example of what Settings might look like in app.core.config:

```python
from pydantic import BaseSettings


class Settings(BaseSettings):
    app_name: str = "Plant Care"
    database_url: str
    jwt_secret_key: str
    jwt_algorithm: str = "HS256"

    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"
```

In this example, Settings defines several configuration settings for the application, including the app_name,
database_url, jwt_secret_key, and jwt_algorithm. The app_name setting has a default value of "Plant Care", while the
other settings do not have default values and must be set using environment variables or a configuration file.

The Config class inside Settings specifies additional configuration options. In this example, we're using the env_file
option to load environment variables from a file called .env.

By defining Settings in this way, we can easily access the application's configuration settings from anywhere in the
application using a settings object. For example, we might use settings.database_url to retrieve the URL for the
application's database connection. This makes it easy to keep configuration settings in one place and ensure that
they're consistent throughout the application.

What is the purpose of  'security' in app.api.utils?
The security module inside app.api.utils is typically used to define security-related functions and utilities for use in
FastAPI endpoints.

In FastAPI applications, security is often used in conjunction with authentication and authorization libraries like
OAuth2 or JWT. The security module might contain functions that validate authentication credentials or authorization
tokens, or utilities that generate secure random values for use in the application.

Here's an example of what might be inside app.api.utils.security for a FastAPI web app:

```python
from passlib.context import CryptContext
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from jose import JWTError, jwt
from app.core.config import Settings

pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=["bcrypt"], deprecated="auto")

settings = Settings()


def verify_password(plain_password, hashed_password):
    return pwd_context.verify(plain_password, hashed_password)


def get_password_hash(password):
    return pwd_context.hash(password)


def create_access_token(data: dict, expires_delta: timedelta = None):
    to_encode = data.copy()
    if expires_delta:
        expire = datetime.utcnow() + expires_delta
    else:
        expire = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=15)
    to_encode.update({"exp": expire})
    encoded_jwt = jwt.encode(to_encode, settings.jwt_secret_key, algorithm=settings.jwt_algorithm)
    return encoded_jwt


def decode_access_token(token: str):
    try:
        payload = jwt.decode(token, settings.jwt_secret_key, algorithms=[settings.jwt_algorithm])
        return payload
    except JWTError:
        return None
```

In this example, the security module defines several functions and utilities that are used for security-related tasks in
the application. The verify_password and get_password_hash functions are used to hash and verify user passwords, while
the create_access_token and decode_access_token functions are used to create and verify JSON Web Tokens (JWTs

What is the purpose of  'crud' in app.db ?
The crud module inside app.db is typically used to define functions that perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
operations on database tables.

In FastAPI applications, crud functions are often used in conjunction with an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library
like SQLAlchemy to interact with a database. The crud module might contain functions that create new rows in a database
table, retrieve rows based on certain criteria, update existing rows, or delete rows from a table.

Here's an example of what might be inside app.db.crud for a FastAPI web app:

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from app.db import models, schemas


def create_plant(db: Session, plant: schemas.PlantCreate, user_id: int):
    db_plant = models.Plant(**plant.dict(), owner_id=user_id)
    db.add(db_plant)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_plant)
    return db_plant


def get_plant(db: Session, plant_id: int):
    return db.query(models.Plant).filter(models.Plant.id == plant_id).first()


def get_plants(db: Session, skip: int = 0, limit: int = 100):
    return db.query(models.Plant).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()


def update_plant(db: Session, plant_id: int, plant: schemas.PlantUpdate):
    db_plant = db.query(models.Plant).filter(models.Plant.id == plant_id).first()
    for key, value in plant.dict(exclude_unset=True).items():
        setattr(db_plant, key, value)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_plant)
    return db_plant


def delete_plant(db: Session, plant_id: int):
    db_plant = db.query(models.Plant).filter(models.Plant.id == plant_id).first()
    db.delete(db_plant)
    db.commit()
```

In this example, the crud module defines several functions that perform CRUD operations on a Plant table in a database.
The create_plant function creates a new Plant row in the database, the get_plant function retrieves a specific Plant row
by ID, the get_plants function retrieves a list of Plant rows with pagination, the update_plant function updates a
specific Plant row, and the delete_plant function deletes a specific Plant row.

These crud functions can be used by FastAPI endpoints to interact with the database and perform CRUD operations on Plant
rows. This helps to keep database access code separate from the web app's business logic, making the code easier to
read, maintain, and test.
